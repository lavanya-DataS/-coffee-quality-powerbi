☕ Exploring Coffee Quality Data with Power BI
📖 About the Dataset

The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), founded in 1996 in California, USA, is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality and value of coffee worldwide. CQI collaborates with growers, processors, roasters, and other industry stakeholders to:

- Promote coffee quality standards

- Support sustainability in coffee production

- Strengthen the specialty coffee industry

This dataset includes:

- Coffee production and processing methods

- Genetics, soil types, and origin regions

- Sensory evaluation scores: aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean cup, and sweetness

Defects categorized as:

- Category One – black beans, sour beans, insect damage (visually identifiable)

- Category Two – staleness, over-fermentation, chemical taste (detectable through tasting)

💡 Note: Total Cup Points represents the overall coffee quality score and is the sum of the ten sensory attributes.

🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize coffee quality data using Power BI to answer key research questions:

What are the main determinants of coffee quality such as aroma, flavor, and acidity?

How do processing methods and origin regions correlate with quality scores?

What patterns exist in defect occurrences, and how do they affect overall coffee quality?

How do different variables interact to influence Total Cup Points?

🛠 Tools & Techniques

- Power BI – for data cleaning, modeling, and creating interactive dashboards

- Power Query – for transforming data, handling missing values, and formatting

- Data Visualizations – bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and KPI cards for insights

📊 Key Insights & Deliverables

This project delivers an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore sensory attributes and coffee quality scores. It highlights correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and cup points, and provides visual analysis of defect types and their impact on overall coffee quality.
